The Concept
This research project, conducted for my Master's thesis, addresses a critical challenge in urban climate science: identifying optimal locations for hyper-local temperature monitoring of Urban Heat Islands (UHI). The existing network of volunteer-generated sensor data often misses strategically important spots. This work developed a novel, data-driven strategy to guide the placement of new sensors by combining machine learning-based geostatistics with socio-economic vulnerability analysis, ensuring that future monitoring efforts are both scientifically robust and socially equitable.

How It Works & Key Features
The methodology follows a clear, multi-stage analytical pipeline, moving from data preparation to strategic recommendations.

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: The first step involved rigorously cleaning the existing sensor data. Using statistical methods in Python, I identified and filtered out faulty readings and sensors placed indoors, which do not accurately represent the urban outdoor climate, ensuring the highest data quality for model training.

Spatial Prediction & Uncertainty Modeling: The core of the project was building a Regression-Kriging model in Python. This advanced geostatistical technique combines a regression model with spatial interpolation.

Predictor Variables: The model used a suite of high-resolution morphological factors—including building height, density, green/water coverage, and Sky View Factor—to predict temperature variations across Utrecht.

Target Variable: The cleaned temperature readings from the existing sensor network.

Uncertainty Mapping: A key output was not just a prediction surface, but an associated prediction uncertainty surface. Areas with high uncertainty indicate locations where the model lacks confidence due to a lack of data or complex, unmeasured local factors—making them prime candidates for new sensors.

Integrating Socio-Economic Vulnerability: To ensure the strategy addressed human impact, I overlayed the uncertainty data with socio-economic indicators (e.g., population density, age, income). This highlighted areas that are both poorly understood by the current model and highly vulnerable to the health impacts of extreme heat.

Strategic Cluster Identification: Using clustering algorithms on the combined uncertainty and vulnerability data, I identified specific, prioritized zones for sensor deployment. This provided city planners with a clear, actionable map for expanding the monitoring network effectively.

The Technology Behind It
This project is a showcase of advanced geospatial data science implemented with open-source tools.

Data Processing & Analysis: The entire data pipeline—from cleaning and statistical analysis to machine learning modeling—was built in Python.

Geospatial & Machine Learning Libraries: I leveraged powerful libraries including GeoPandas for spatial data manipulation, Scikit-learn for the regression modelling, and SciPy and PyKrige for the geostatistical interpolation and uncertainty quantification.

Visualization & GIS: QGIS was indispensable for creating high-quality, publication-ready cartographic visualizations of the input data and model results, and for working with spatial file formats.

In Summary
This thesis project demonstrates the power of integrating machine learning, geostatistics, and social science to solve a complex urban planning challenge. By moving beyond simple data visualization to predictive uncertainty modeling, it provides a scientifically-grounded, ethical framework for deploying environmental sensor networks that can make cities more resilient to climate change.
